    "###### Some Important Points about Variable scope in Java:\n",
    "- In general, a set of curly brackets { } defines a scope.\n",
    "- In Java we can usually access a variable as long as it was defined within the same set of brackets as the code we are writing or within any curly brackets inside of the curly brackets where the variable was defined.\n",
    "- Any variable defined in a class outside of any method can be used by all member methods.\n",
    "- When a method has same local variable as a member, this keyword can be used to reference the current class variable.\n",
    "- For a variable to be read after the termination of a loop, It must be declared before the body of the loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Important rules for switch statements :\n",
    "- Duplicate case values are not allowed.\n",
    "- The value for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch.\n",
    "- The value for a case must be a constant or a literal.Variables are not allowed.\n",
    "- The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.\n",
    "- The break statement is optional. If omitted, execution will continue on into the next case.\n",
    "- The default statement is optional, and it must appear at the end of the switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### String in Switch Case in Java \n",
    "- Expensive operation: Switching on strings can be more expensive in term of execution than switching on primitive data types. Therefore, it is best to switch on strings only in cases in which the controlling data is already in string form.\n",
    "- String should not be NULL: Ensure that the expression in any switch statement is not null while working with strings to prevent a NullPointerException from being thrown at run-time. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Do we need forward declarations in Java?\n",
    "- Unlike C++, we don’t need forward declarations in Java. Identifiers (class and method names) are recognized automatically from source files. Similarly, library methods are directly read from the libraries, and there is no need to create header files with declarations.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Test2 {      \n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {    \n",

    "#### Type promotion in Expressions\n",
    "While evaluating expressions, the intermediate value may exceed the range of operands and hence the expression value will be promoted. Some conditions for type promotion are:\n",
    "1. Java automatically promotes each byte, short, or char operand to int when evaluating an expression.\n",
    "2. If one operand is a long,float or double the whole expression is promoted to long,float or double respectively.\n",

    "    3. Documentation comments.\n",

    "-  **Static vs Non static Methods:** We cannot call a non-static method on a reference variable with null value, it will throw NullPointerException, but we can call static method with reference variables with null values. Since static methods are bonded using static binding, they won’t throw Null pointer Exception.\n",
