    "### What is an Exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error vs Exception\n",
    "- Error: An Error indicates serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.\n",
    "- Exception: Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Hierarchy\n",
    "All exception and errors types are sub classes of class Throwable, which is base class of hierarchy.One branch is headed by Exception. This class is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. NullPointerException is an example of such an exception.Another branch,Error are used by the Java run-time system(JVM) to indicate errors having to do with the run-time environment itself(JRE). StackOverflowError is an example of such an error.\n",

    "### Points to remember :\n",
    "1. In a method, there can be more than one statements that might throw exception, So put all these statements within its own try block and provide separate exception handler within own catch block for each of them.\n",
    "2. If an exception occurs within the try block, that exception is handled by the exception handler associated with it. To associate exception handler, we must put catch block after it. There can be more than one exception handlers. Each catch block is a exception handler that handles the exception of the type indicated by its argument. The argument, ExceptionType declares the type of the exception that it can handle and must be the name of the class that inherits from Throwable class.\n",
    "3. For each try block there can be zero or more catch blocks, but only one finally block.\n",
    "4. The finally block is optional.It always gets executed whether an exception occurred in try block or not . If exception occurs, then it will be executed after try and catch blocks. And if exception does not occur then it will be executed after the try block. The finally block in java is used to put important codes such as clean up code e.g. closing the file or closing the connection.\n",
