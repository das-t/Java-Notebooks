    "<b>Explanation:</b> When a new thread is created, the thread is in the NEW state. When .start() method is called on a thread, the thread scheduler moves it to Runnable state. Whenever join() method is called on a thread instance, the current thread executing that statement will wait for this thread to move to Terminated state. So, before the final statement is printed on the console, the program calls join() on thread2 making the thread1 wait while thread2 completes its execution and is moved to Terminated state. thread1 goes to Waiting state because it it waiting for thread2 to complete it’s execution as it has called join on thread2.\n",

    "### java Concurrency – yield(), sleep() and join() methods\n",
    "1. **yeild:** Suppose there are three threads t1, t2, and t3. Thread t1 gets the processor and starts its execution and thread t2 and t3 are in Ready/Runnable state. Completion time for thread t1 is 5 hour and completion time for t2 is 5 minutes. Since t1 will complete its execution after 5 hours, t2 has to wait for 5 hours to just finish 5 minutes job. In such scenarios where one thread is taking too much time to complete its execution, we need a way to prevent execution of a thread in between if something important is pending. yeild() helps us in doing so.\n",
    "yield() basically means that the thread is not doing anything particularly important and if any other threads or processes need to be run, they should run. Otherwise, the current thread will continue to run.\n",
    "2. **sleep():** This method causes the currently executing thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds, subject to the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers.\n",
    "3. **join():** The join() method of a Thread instance is used to join the start of a thread’s execution to end of other thread’s execution such that a thread does not start running until another thread ends. If join() is called on a Thread instance, the currently running thread will block until the Thread instance has finished executing.\n",
