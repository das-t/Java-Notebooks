    "## Callable and Future in Java\n",
    "There are two ways of creating threads – one by extending the Thread class and other by creating a thread with a Runnable. However, one feature lacking in  Runnable is that we cannot make a thread return result when it terminates, i.e. when run() completes. For supporting this feature, the Callable interface is present in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callable vs Runnable:**\n",
    "1. For implementing Runnable, the run() method needs to be implemented which does not return anything, while for a Callable, the call() method needs to be implemented which returns a result on completion. Note that a thread can’t be created with a Callable, it can only be created with a Runnable.\n",
    "2. Another difference is that the call() method can throw an exception whereas run() cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Java program to illustrate Callable to return a random number\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Future\n",
    "When the call() method completes, answer must be stored in an object known to the main thread, so that the main thread can know about the result that the thread returned. How will the program store and obtain this result later? For this, a Future object can be used. Think of a Future as an object that holds the result – it may not hold it right now, but it will do so in the future (once the Callable returns). Thus, a Future is basically one way the main thread can keep track of the progress and result from other threads. To implement this interface, 5 methods have to be overridden, but as the example below uses a concrete implementation from the library, only the important methods are listed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that Callable and Future do two different things – Callable is similar to Runnable, in that it encapsulates a task that is meant to run on another thread, whereas a Future is used to store a result obtained from a different thread. In fact, the Future can be made to work with Runnable as well, which is something that will become clear when Executors come into the picture.\n",
