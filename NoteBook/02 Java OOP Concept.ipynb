    "## Overriding in Java\n",
    "In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for method overriding:\n",
    "1. **Overriding and Access-Modifiers:** The access modifier for an overriding method can allow more, but not less, access than the overridden method. For example, a protected instance method in the super-class can be made public, but not private, in the subclass. Doing so, will generate compile-time error. \n",
    "2. **Final methods can not be overridden**\n",
    "3. **Static methods can not be overridden**\n",
    "4. **Private methods can not be overridden:** Private methods cannot be overridden as they are bonded during compile time. Therefore we can’t even override private methods in a subclass.(See this for details).\n",
    "5. **The overriding method must have same return type (or subtype):** From Java 5.0 onwards it is possible to have different return type for a overriding method in child class, but child’s return type should be sub-type of parent’s return type. This phenomena is known as **covariant return type**.\n",
    "6. **Overriding and constructor:** We can not override constructor as parent and child class can never have constructor with same name(Constructor name must always be same as Class name).\n",
    "7. **Overriding and Exception-Handling:** Below are two rules to note when overriding methods related to exception-handling.\n",
    "    - **Rule#1 :** If the super-class overridden method does not throws an exception, subclass overriding method can only throws the unchecked exception, throwing checked exception will lead to compile-time error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "    class Parent{\n",
    "        void m1() { System.out.println(\"From parent m1()\");}\n",
    "        void m2() { System.out.println(\"From parent  m2()\"); }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Child extends Parent\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        @Override\n",
    "        // no issue while throwing unchecked exception\n",
    "        void m1() throws ArithmeticException{ System.out.println(\"From child m1()\");}\n",
    "\n",
    "        @Override\n",
    "        // compile-time error\n",
    "        // issue while throwin checked exception\n",
    "        void m2() throws Exception{ System.out.println(\"From child m2\");}\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - **Rule#2 :** If the super-class overridden method does throws an exception, subclass overriding method can only throw same, subclass exception. Throwing parent exception in Exception hierarchy will lead to compile time error.Also there is no issue if subclass overridden method is not throwing any exception. \n",
    "        ```java\n",
