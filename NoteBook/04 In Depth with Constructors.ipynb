    "### Can we call sub class constructor from super class constructor?\n",
    "No. There is no way in java to call sub class constructor from a super class constructor.\n",

    "### What happens if you keep a return type for a constructor?\n",
    "Ideally, Constructor must not have a return type. By definition, if a method has a return type, it’s not a constructor.(JLS8.8 Declaration) It will be treated as a normal method. But compiler gives a warning saying that method has a constructor name.\n",

    "Constructor without arguments is called no-arg constructor. Default constructor in java is always a no-arg constructor.\n",
    "\n",

    "No, Because Java is a garbage collected language you cannot predict when (or even if) an object will be destroyed. Hence there is no direct equivalent of a destructor.\n",

    "### How a no – argument constructor is different from default Constructor?\n",
    "If a class contains no constructor declarations, then a default constructor with no formal parameters and no throws clause is implicitly declared. If the class being declared is the primordial class Object, then the default constructor has an empty body. Otherwise, the default constructor simply invokes the superclass constructor with no arguments."
